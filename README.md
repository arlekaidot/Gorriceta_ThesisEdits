# A THESIS PROJECT FOR THE COMPLETION OF CCS 233 BSCS-4BAI

Coronavirus or Covid-19 was initially reported to the World Health Organization in December 2019. It was not until March 2020 that the outbreak was declared a global pandemic. As countries scrambled to handle the outbreak, it became clear that although there were precautions being taken - it made a devastating blow to the livelihoods of many of the citizens residing in countries that were less prepared for the outbreak.With this in mind, the researchers of this study are focusing on the utilization of tools and technologies to better understand and handle the situation of Covid-19 and infectious diseases in Iloilo.

This study generally aims to make use of newer algorithms such as PythonAF (Python Automatic Forecasting) to forecast future positivity rates, utilizing Multiple Linear Regression.
